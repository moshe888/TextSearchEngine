# TextSearchEngine

The TextSearchEngine project is a Java program that allows users to search for keywords within text files in a given directory. It includes several search algorithms, such as a basic search, a parallel search, and searches using different caching algorithms. The program can also log search results and cache usage to a specified file. It has been developed using test-driven development and includes unit tests for each component of the program. The program is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new search and caching algorithms in the future.
