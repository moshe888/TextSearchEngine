**Text Search Engine for File System Analysis**

**Project Overview:**
Developed a sophisticated text search engine designed to efficiently search through nested file systems. The project involved the implementation of advanced software development concepts and design patterns, targeting optimization in file handling and data retrieval.

**Key Contributions and Technologies:**

- **Design and Development:** Spearheaded the creation of a robust search engine capable of navigating complex directory structures. The project was developed using Java, emphasizing OOP principles and multithreading for enhanced performance.

- **Concurrency Patterns:** Implemented Thread Pool and Fork-Join Pool for parallel processing of recursive tasks, significantly reducing search times across extensive file systems.

- **Design Patterns Integration:** Utilized a variety of design patterns including Proxy, Flyweight, Decorator, Observer, and Thread Safe Singleton, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and efficient architecture.

- **Caching Mechanism:** Developed a smart caching system (CacheIOSearcher) using flyweight design pattern to minimize redundant IO operations, enhancing search efficiency. Further optimized with LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching strategies for managing memory usage effectively.

- **Observable Pattern:** Incorporated the Observer design pattern to monitor and respond to changes in the search cache, enhancing real-time data handling capabilities.

- **Testing and Documentation:** Rigorously tested each component for functionality and adherence to design patterns. Ensured comprehensive documentation for future scalability and maintenance.

- **Result Handling:** Implemented a custom Result interface to encapsulate search results effectively, facilitating easy retrieval and manipulation of data.

**Outcome:**
The project successfully delivered a high-performance text search engine, showcasing my ability to apply advanced software concepts and design patterns in a real-world application. It demonstrated my capabilities in efficient problem-solving, code optimization, and developing scalable software solutions.
